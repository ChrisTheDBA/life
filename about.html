      <h3>What is the meaning of life?</h3>
      <p>
        Attempts have been given in plenty to answer this question. The first philosophers
        thought about it, discussed it, and on rare occasions got something written down.
        Contemporary works also exists. In our inspirations can be found in the inspirations
        section, but most notable is <a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/">
        The Book of Life</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is not of a competetive art. We try to reinterpret and think
        about the meaning of life, and convey it. We would not recommend using this as an only
        source of inspiration for life, but let it inspire you to live a more fruitful and
        satisfying life.
